# WEEK 5 TASK
## About Task
The Week 5 Task was:
```
Download some sample Java web service.
Follow tutorials on Docker in order to containerize the service and run it using a simple Tomcat Server.

What to submit:
Submit a link to your repository where you must have the following:
1. Dockerfile
2. Docker-compose
3. Instructions on which commands to use to run your service in a container (i.e. compile, build image, run container)
4. A simple .txt file describing your methodology and how you tested that your service API still works in the container.

Note: if you don't use Docker-compose, but your solution works, then that is ok. Just document what commands the user must run.
